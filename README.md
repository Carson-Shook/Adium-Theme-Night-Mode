# Adium-Theme-Night-Mode
A theme for Adium that looks decent on MacOS's dark menubar

*Since Adium's community seems to be almost dead, and I have no desire to create an account for one thing, I'm going to just host this on GitHub because "Why not?"*

### What Is It?
Night Mode is a theme for Adium that more or less fits in with the dark menubar introduced in recent versions of MacOS. It supports retina Macs (in theory) as well. 

### Why Make this?
What made this more complicated than simply inverting the icons was Adium's built in automatic inverting of an icon when it is clicked on. Inverting the existing icon made it appear invisible when clicked on (since when inverted, it would be black, and black is treated as transparent by the menubar's theming when the colors are inverted). So I was bored one day and took the time to figure out what would actually look nice.

### How To Install It
1. Download it, and double-click on `Night Mode.AdiumMenuBarIcons`.
2. Open Adium's `Preferences > Appearance` and change Menu Bar Icons to `Night Mode`
3. That's it. If you want to uninstall it, then use Adium's Xtras Manager.
